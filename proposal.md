# CS30 Major Project

## Description
I am trying to build a clone of Mario. I will try to clone it as closely  as possible and will try to include the backgrounds and original soundtrack+sceneries from the original game.

## Needs to have list
  - Multiple platforms to hop to
  - a suitable map identical or almost identical to the game
  - original sound effects

  - Multiple types of enemies
  - breakable blocks for xp


## Nice to have list
  - boss fights
  - good ui 
  - powerups
  - something to customize how mario looks (clothes or accesories)
